# MPDB
The multi-purpose discord bot!
Written in Node.JS
 
# But why?
There are arguably millions of bots that operate on discord. Hundreds of them are big production bots.
Many of them serve the same purpose. This one won't, though. This is a moderation bot (I know, big deal) 
with a twist added with web developers in mind. It can interface with google's lighthouse to produce 
website rankings for you to brag about, among many other options I'm working on actively. It also operates 
on mongodb to ensure multi-server capability. Do note that it is NOT ready. Use at your own discretion.

# LicensingðŸ”’
This bot is open-source under GPL-3.0.
Use at will.

# Where can I find it?
